Interface/controls
	GUI w/ difficulty
		Easy: Depth first search generation
		Hard: True Prim's algorithm
	Change controls after winning to be more conventional for a top down view
	organic controls (vs current discrete movements)
	interaction with Scene objects
	smaller timer font with total time below current floor time
	keep keys in same hand (2 separate inventories)
	
Scenery/variation
	surrounding mountains with Perlin noise
	angled wall surfaces/objects that stick out from the walls (see Sector 2 base of Coded Arms)
	big rooms (but not so big as to encompass the entire level)
	archways
	walls randomly rotate (collision unaffected)
	wall textures
	grate textures
	random ceilings in 2D
	Camera2 sweep 2π about φ and π/2 about θ upon completion
	lights gradually turn on during initialization
	pulse between any 2 colors
	music visualizer color scheme
	grass in random space within tiles
	matrix rain/particle system
	open rooms in mazes
	initialize with random 'visited' area(s), add to list separate from objects, place unique geometries in those spaces, n--;
		fish? monoliths?

collectibles
	Key fragments that assemble
		not necessarily key geometry
	pellets (visit 50% of the space to open the door)
	jellybeans - to prevent from getting lost (limited)
	special objects to pass through areas (think chips challenge)
	
Concepts for new mechanics
	Keys that open up things other than doors
		raise/lower a platform
		switches that alternate accessibility to 2 or more segments of the maze
		
	Time limit per maze adjusted to number of floors descended
		total time tracked, may function as score based on how long you can live
	push block
		at intersections or to fill a hole
		open room puzzle?
	Puzzle room checkpoints, door locks behind
		combination doorlock
		ice floor slide puzzle
		toggle floor tiles, light all the space (think Qbert)
		moving walkway/one way door puzzle
	stop utilizing every possible space, but increase the max length & width possible
		either mark clusters of spaces to be scenery, or randomly select single spaces
	eliminate right wall surfing
		Braiding - eliminate random walls and recalculate maxpathlength
		phase between 2 mazes - teleporters?
			>3 dimensions with multiple views
	level stacking (2D + completion sends you up a level in the stack)
	island+connector mazes
	flash solution path for a few seconds as a limited use tool
	Maze reset after taking too long (limited # of lives?)
		pulse to indicate running out of time and blackout
		max pathlength to deadends from current position, x nCr 1 instead of x nCr 2
	Red Herrings
	Rotating room
		gravity changes to allow pathfinding on walls/ceiling
	Multiple floors
		Platforming
		Ramps, springs, trapdoors
		pass above/below segments of the maze
	Chip's Challenge
		new array for floor tile types
		new collision ray for floor tile
			can't walk unless floor tile is solid (3D especially)
			swap between ceiling and floor (gravity flip)
	Mazes on polygonal surfaces
		irregular arrays that have rule sets determining which point to wrap around once border is reached
		[may work best with island and connector maze concept]
	circular mazes
