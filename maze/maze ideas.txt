Interface/controls
	GUI w/ difficulty
		Easy: Depth first search generation
		Hard: True Prim's algorithm
	Change controls after winning to be more conventional for a top down view
	organic controls
	
Scenery/variation
	big rooms (but not so big as to encompass the entire level)
	archways
	walls randomly rotate (collision unaffected)
	wall textures
	grate textures
	random ceilings in 2D
	Camera2 sweep 2π about φ and π/2 about θ upon completion
	lights gradually turn on during initialization
	pulse between any 2 colors
	music visualizer color scheme
	grass in random space within tiles
	matrix rain/particle system
	open rooms in mazes
	initialize with random 'visited' area(s), add to list separate from objects, place unique geometries in those spaces, n--;
		fish? monoliths?

collectibles
	pellets (visit 50% of the space to open the door)
	jellybeans - to prevent from getting lost (limited)
	special objects to pass through areas (think chips challenge)
	
new mechanics
	push block
		at intersections or to fill a hole
		open room puzzle?
	Puzzle checkpoints
	stop utilizing every possible space, but increase the max length & width possible
		either mark clusters of spaces to be impassable, or randomly select single spaces
	eliminate right wall surfing
		Braiding - eliminate random walls and recalculate maxpathlength
		phase between 2 mazes
	level stacking (2D + completion sends you up a level in the stack)
	island+connector mazes
	flash solution path for a few seconds as a limited use tool
	Maze reset after taking too long
		pulse to indicate running out of time and blackout
		max pathlength to deadends from current position, x nCr 1 instead of x nCr 2
	Platforming
		goes along with maze weaving
	Red Herrings

Big picture ideas
	Escape from burning building
		office building with windows, random textures, objects (blocking?)
	Firefighter in burning building
		timed, multi floor with stairs
	Pyramid (1x1,3x3,5x5,... or 1x1,2x2,3x3...), descend on completion
	Hide from hunters, temporary hiding spots, patrols, doors+keys
	classic win98
	
	
	Chip's Challenge
		new array for floor tile types
		new collision ray for floor tile
			can't walk unless floor tile is solid (3D especially)
			swap between ceiling and floor (gravity flip)
	Mazes on sides of polygons
		irregular arrays that have rule sets determining which point to wrap around once border is reached
		[island and connector mazes]
	circular maze in garden
	platforming elements like moving floors to jump to
	Vascular
